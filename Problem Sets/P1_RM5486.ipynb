How can we simulate this using the Python code? We can simulate this using python code by choosing a random integer between 1 and 2 a million times. If the number is 1 we assume it means heads and if it is 2 we assume that means tails. In the end, we count the number of 1s we get out of a million tries and the ratio should be around 0.5.\n",

In simple words, for the purposes of this task, you can think of it as a tool that counts objects in a given sequence, and returns a dictionary of those counts. It is a very useful and handy tool for frequency-based analyses. Here are a few examples of how Counter can be used using sequences."
