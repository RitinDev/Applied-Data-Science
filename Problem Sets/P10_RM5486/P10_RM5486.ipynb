        "\n",
        "There are typically (though arguably) 6 different **modalities** or modes of data that a data scientist encounters in their work: (i) numbers; (ii) text; (iii) images; (iv) audio/speech; (v) video, and (vi) graphs/networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are separate fields and courses pertaining to each of these modalities offered in many of the academic institutions. For example, if you want to learn about text, you would take a *Natural Language Processing (NLP)* or a *Text Processing* course. For in-depth understanding of images and video, you would take a *Multimedia Analysis* or a *Computer Vision (CV)* course. To learn about audio or speech, you would take a *Speech Processing* or *Audio Processing* course. To learn about graphs and networks, you would take a *Network Science* or a *Graph Theory* course. These courses cover in-depth understanding of how to *process* and *represent* data of a given modality, and also teach the basic challenges within each field. That said, as of 2021, most of the state-of-the-art methods to deal with all of these modalities have somehow coverged to using *neural networks* in some form, and so to learn the state-of-the-art methods in neural networks, you would take a *Deep learning* course. Still, learning about the basics of how to *represent* data from different modalities is key to being successful in that particular field.\n",
        "\n",
        "In most of your assignments so far, you have dealt with the first modality i.e. numbers. This is by design, as all the other modalities can typically be converted to (scalars or vectors or some form of) numbers, and so dealing with other modalities mostly requires you to *transform* your data to numbers: *Textual data* can be converted to frequency values or other vector representations as you have briefly seen in P7 and R12; *images* typically get converted to pixel values or other vector representations; *videos* are basically images in time; *speech/audio* typically get converted to spectrograms which are basically similar to images; finally, *networks* can be represented as lists, matrices or vector representations. But, in the end, all data is just numbers. Arguably, most data can just be converted to vectors or as you now know *embeddings*. This has led to papers such as [*Word2Vec*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) for text, [*Wave2Vec*](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/wav2vec-state-of-the-art-speech-recognition-through-self-supervision/) for speech, [*node2vec*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2939672.2939754) and [*graph2vec*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05005) for graphs and networks, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "To reiterate, an *embedding* is a relatively *low-dimensional* space into which you can translate high-dimensional vectors/data. Some images are big, some images are small, some images are black and white, some are RGB. Similarly, some voice recordings are long, some are short. Embeddings are a way to (i) represent high dimensional data into a compact representation to easily deal with the data in downstream tasks, and (ii) one that is standardized across different types of data. As a result, they make relationships between different instances easier and more *meaningful* like you saw in the case of *Word embeddings* in the *visualization* assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will use *embeddings* not for words, but instead for *speech* (or *speakers*) for the task of *speaker recognition/identification*, *speaker gender recognition*, and *speaker age estimation*.\n",

        "\n",
        "The [United States Coast Guard (USCG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard) handles about 16,000 *Mayday* calls for help every year. Every distress call the Coast Guard receives compels the federal agency to launch an expensive search-and-rescue effort involving at a minimum a small rescue boat, a C-130 fixed-wing aircraft or rescue helicopter, and the several Coast Guardsmen to operate them. The cost of each outing can run from \\$10,000 to \\$250,000. Small boats typically cost \\$4,500 per hour to operate, whereas the helicopters can cost about \\$16,000.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately,  **about 1 percent of these distress calls are fake**. The men and women of the Coast Guard put themselves at risk every time the surface and air assets respond to a call for assistance. **Hoax callers** place Coast Guardsmen at unnecessary risk. Furthermore, hoax calls interfere with legitimate search and rescue cases, diverting assets from being available to help actual mariners in distress.\n",
        "\n",
        "The penalty for transmitting a hoax distress call to the Coast Guard is up to six years in prison, a \\$250,000 fine, a \\$5,000 civil fine, and reimbursement to the Coast Guard for the cost of performing the search. Nevertheless, recently, an anonymous caller cost the U.S. Coast Guard roughly \\$500,000 by sending first responders on unnecessary rescue missions 28 times through hoax calls. The hoax caller made 28 calls, everytime speaking in a different voice to fool USCG. *True story*. <sup>1</sup>\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, the USCG does not have a system to be able to identify the voice of the person making the call. If they had such a system, every time a distress call came, they could have matched it to the voices of the callers from the past to make sure it was a legit call. If a caller had been red-flagged in the past, such a system would have been able to identify if the same person made the call again just by using a voice-matching system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your voice is like a fingerprint, and a voice-matching system is typically robust enough to not be fooled even if you try to change your voice.\n",
        "\n",
        "The USCG has thus reached out to NYUAD's data scientists for help in creating a system through which they can recognize speakers through their voices. Because most fake callers do not speak in their own voice, USCG is not even able to make out other states of the caller such as their gender. Therefore USCG would want to go one step ahead and also create two other machine learning models that are able to detect the **gender**, and the **age** of the speaker.\n",

More concretely, in this dataset, we have given you 4 d-vectors for each speaker. What you will notice is that if you take the **euclidean distance** of two d-vectors from the same speaker, and the **euclidean distance** of any of those two d-vectors to a d-vector from another speaker, the euclidean distance between d-vectors from same speaker will be much smaller i.e. **d-vectors from the same speaker will be closer to each other**. If you are curious, you can check this for yourself by selecting a few random speakers and d-vectors, and using scikit-learn's **[euclidean distance metric](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.euclidean_distances.html)** to compute distances.

This problem set is different from all others because it revolves around a large dataset and requires more computation and arguably less thinking. If you ever want to pursue a career in machine learning, you will deal with datasets that are as large, if not more, as this, and will deal with the same problems. We could have instead given you a small dataset, but a big goal of this homework is for you to be able to deal with large real-world datasets.\n",

        "- Because it’s a large dataset, it is likely that your models will take more time to train (and test). Therefore, running time can range from a minute to even hours if you are using grid search over many parameters. The strategy for this homework, therefore, is to start with simpler models without grid search and parameter tuning — models that will train and predict quicker, and then gradually add grid search and other parameters if needed. If you cannot figure out via intuition which models are simple and will supposedly run quicker, you can figure this out empirically by trying them out on a small subset of your training set (i.e. via sampling). If your model is taking more than 10 minutes, then it’s not a simple model, try something simpler first. If you try simpler models, and are not able to pass the baselines/benchmarks, only then move to complex models, and/or more parameters.\n",

Most of the classification models you have learnt in class have their corresponding regression modules on scikit-learn.

        "\n",
        "## Model Selection\n",
        "There are many supervised machine learning models for the task of *classification*, and *regression*: k-nearest neighbours, decision trees, random forests, logistic/linear regression, support vector machines, neural networks, polynomial regression, and so on. Some models are specific to classification, some to regression, and some to both. There are many models to choose from, and for each model, there are **many** parameters to tune your model on. Of course, you can brute force, and try *all* the models in the world, and tune *all* the parameters on *all* the possible values. But that is not just infeasible, but would be result in some heavy overfitting.\n",
        "So how do you choose the right model for a given problem? This is really big question. The ability to choose the right model, the right architecture, and tune the right set of parameters efficiently requires deep understanding of the task at hand, years of practice, and knowledge of the literature.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Embeddings\n",
        "Notice, how across all the tasks, you did not really have to deal with any **\".wav\"** or **\".mp3\"** files, or any sort of audio/speech processing. In fact, if we had not told you that these *embeddings* or *d-vectors* corresponded to voice recordings, or had not provided you with the Coast Guard context, you had no idea of knowing. For you to accomplish the tasks above, all you needed to know was that these vectors of numbers are *features* to be used in your model, very similar to PS9 where your features were unknown. That is precisely the beauty of *embeddings* in general that they abstract out modality related details for a data scientist to just focus on the task of *modeling*. That said, it is also important to acknowledge that many recent machine learning or deep learning models are actually *end-to-end*, and don't use embeddings at all i.e. for example an audio spectrogram goes into the neural network as input, and out comes the prediction. Of course, all of these statements are simplified versions of complex details, understanding of which requires significant domain knowledge.\n",

        "In the context of embeddings though, a wide variety of research is being conducted on what is the best embedding for a given modality and type of data -- the reason why we went from Word2Vec to GLOVE to ELMo to BERT to [RoBERTA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) to [GPT-2](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) and [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) for textual data. As of end of 2020, BERT, RoBERTA, GPT-2, and GPT-3 are the most common *pre-trained* deep learning based [*language models*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model) being used for extracting word-embeddings. Figuring out the optimal architecture for extracting embeddings for a given modality is an art in itself -- one that is essential in the building of real world systems such as Alexa or Google Home, but teaching which is, unfortunately, out of the scope of this course. We encourage you to take courses in *deep learning* and *NLP* to learn these methods in detail as a follow-up to this course."
