In fact this will be true for most of the libraries you learn to use in the class. One of the goals of this course is to introduce you to new tools, and then help you practice to help yourself. We have designed the course, its exercises, and its recitations to reinforce the key concepts taught in the lectures, but also introduce you to new concepts. Therefore, we expect you to look up and be able to read documentations of different libraries, and learn new functions on your own whenever possible. With time, libraries and tools will keep getting better, and it's important for prospective data scientists to be able to learn new concepts whenever necessary."
