Notice, however, that by default the index starts with 0 while the students' serial number starts from 1. If you open up the CSV file itself, you'll notice that the index isn't actually there and deduce that pandas has created its own new index.

Python does that for us using a handy string function, called `strip()`, that strips white space. We can pass this function in to rename via the `mapper` parameter, which maps any function into the values of the axis indicated.
